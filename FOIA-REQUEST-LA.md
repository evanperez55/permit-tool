### Subject: California Public Records Act Request - Permit Fee Schedules (Digital Format)

Dear Records Custodian,

Under the California Public Records Act (Government Code § 6250 et seq.), I am requesting access to the following public records:

### Records Requested:

1. **Current Permit Fee Schedules** (effective 2025):
   - Electrical permit fee schedule
   - Plumbing permit fee schedule
   - Mechanical/HVAC permit fee schedule
   - General building permit fee schedule

2. **Preferred Format:** Digital/electronic format (PDF, Excel, CSV, or database export)

3. **Historical Data (if available):** Fee schedules from 2024 for comparison purposes

### Purpose & Background:

I am developing a public-facing web application to help contractors, homeowners, and small businesses calculate permit costs across multiple jurisdictions. This tool will:

- Provide transparent, accurate fee estimates before project planning
- Help reduce confusion about permit costs
- Improve public access to government fee information
- Support small businesses in budgeting and compliance

The application will attribute all data to LADBS and include links to official sources.

### Request for Expedited Processing:

I respectfully request expedited processing under Gov. Code § 6253(c) as this information serves the public interest by:

1. Improving transparency in government fee structures
2. Assisting the public in understanding permit requirements
3. Supporting economic development and small business planning

### Additional Requests:

If possible, I would also appreciate:

1. **Update Notifications:** Being added to a mailing list for when fee schedules are updated
2. **API Access (if available):** Information about any programmatic access to fee data
3. **Contact for Technical Questions:** A point of contact for clarifying fee calculation methods

### Format Preference Explanation:

While I understand PDF fee schedules are publicly available on the LADBS website, automated access to these documents is currently blocked by web application firewall (WAF) protections. A direct download link, whitelisted access, or structured data format (Excel/CSV) would eliminate this technical barrier.

### Response Timeline:

Per Gov. Code § 6253(c), I understand you have 10 days to respond to this request. Please let me know:

1. Whether you will comply with this request
2. Any fees associated with processing this request
3. Estimated timeline for providing the records

### Contact Information:

**Name:** [Your Name]
**Email:** [Your Email]
**Phone:** [Your Phone]
**Mailing Address:** [Your Address]

### Fee Waiver Request:

I request a waiver of fees pursuant to Gov. Code § 6253(d) as:

1. This request serves the public interest
2. The records will be used for a non-commercial, public-benefit purpose
3. Disclosure will contribute to public understanding of government operations

If fees are required, please notify me of the estimated cost before processing this request. If costs exceed $50, please contact me for approval before proceeding.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

## Follow-up Strategy

### Timeline:
- **Day 0:** Submit request via email (send to all addresses)
- **Day 3:** Follow up if no acknowledgment received
- **Day 10:** Request status update (10-day deadline)
- **Day 14:** Escalate if no response (contact City Clerk's office)
- **Day 21:** File complaint with California Attorney General if still no response

### Backup Contacts:
- **LADBS Main:** (213) 482-0000
- **City Clerk Public Records:** publicrecordsact@lacity.org
- **LADBS Customer Service:** LADBSCustomerCare@lacity.org

### Expected Outcome:
- **Best case:** Direct PDF links or Excel files within 10-14 days
- **Typical case:** PDF copies mailed/emailed within 14-30 days
- **Worst case:** Denial (unlikely for public fee schedules) - can appeal

### Next Steps After Receiving Data:
1. Save PDFs with metadata (date received, source, FOIA request #)
2. Parse fee schedules and add to database
3. Set up quarterly check-ins with LADBS to get updated schedules
4. Build relationship with LADBS staff for ongoing data access
